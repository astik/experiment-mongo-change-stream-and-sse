# ACEM - POC

## TLDR

- Mongo DB server
  - replicat set is enabled in order to have oplog and allow change stream listener
- Node application _worker_
  - write new message into DB
- Node application _front_
  - register connected clients
  - open a SSE "channel" for each connected client
  - is notified by each new DB entry through change stream events and forward new message to each connected client
  - receive new message from client and write them to DB
- Frontend client
  - register to backend when initialising message list
  - retrieve from backend initial message list
  - send to backend new message
  - receive new messages saved into backend through SSE

## PrÃ©requisite

### Mongo

Deploy new container and enabling replica set:

```sh
# as we need oplog to be available, we need to run a replica set
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name mongodb mongo:4.0.4 --replSet rs0
# the we need to initialize replica set
# connect to container instance
docker exec -it mongodb bash
# -> you're on container instance shell
mongo
# -> you're on container instance mongo shell
# initialize replica set
rs.initiate()
```

### Node application: Worker

TODO: package with docker
TODO: use environment variable in order to externalize DB configuration

### Node application: Front

TODO: use environment variable in order to externalize DB configuration
TODO: use environment variable in order to externalize server configuration
TODO: package with docker

### Client application: ui-react

TODO: use environment variable in order to externalize server configuration
TODO: package with docker
